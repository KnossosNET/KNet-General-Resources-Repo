                "Question":"What is FreeSpace?",
                "Answer":"FreeSpace is a series of video games created by Volition.  The source code for FreeSpace 2 was released in 2002 and has been worked on ever since."
            },

                "Question": "What is FSO?",
                "Answer": "FSO stands for FreeSpace Open, the open source branch of the original source code released by Volition."
            },
            {
                "Question": "Do I need to buy FreeSpace to play?",
                "Answer": "Mods based on FreeSpace 2, like the MediaVPs, require a copy of FreeSpace 2 to function, which can be purchased via Gog or Steam.  Total Conversions (TCs) can be played without purchasing a copy."

            {
                "Question":"Why is this launcher called Knossos?",
                "Answer":"Knossos is the name of something plot related in the FreeSpace games."
            },
            {
                "Question":"What happened to old Knossos?",
                "Answer":"The old version of Knossos was not designed to handle a large number of mods and was also difficult to maintain.  ShivanSPS created Knossos.NET (KNet for short) to fix some of the shortcomings of the original and to learn Avalonia UI."
            
            },
            {

                "Question":"How do I play with shiny new models and textures?",
                "Answer":"The upgraded models and textures are in the FreeSpace Port MediaVPs and Freespace Upgrade MediaVPs mods."
            },
            {
                "Question":"What is a Total Conversion?",
                "Answer":"A Total Conversion is a mod that uses the FreeSpace Open engine but does not require any files from any of the FreeSpace games.  Total Conversions can be fan games or original universes.  Examples include Diaspora, Star Fox: Event Horizon, and Wings of Dawn.  Their play style can vary wildly from original FreeSpace 2."

                "Question":"What controllers does FSO support?  How many can be used at once?",
                "Answer":"FSO can support almost all joysticks and gamepads.  Console controllers, however, often have unresolved issues.  Up to 4 controllers can be connected at once."
            },
            {
                "Question":"Does FSO support VR?",

            },
            {
                "Question":"What games are included in the original story line?",
                "Answer":"The original games are FreeSpace 1, Silent Threat, and FreeSpace 2.  Silent Threat is an expansion pack for FreeSpace 1 and has since been heavily upgraded in the fan-made Silent Threat: Reborn.  We do not recommend playing the original Silent Threat.  FreeSpace 2 did not have an expansion."
            },
            {
                "Question":"What mods should I play first?",
                "Answer":"FreeSpace Port (FreeSpace 1) and FreeSpace 2 are good places to start, since they are designed to be accessible to new players and have good training missions.  After that we recommend asking the community on our Discord.  We can provide recommendations based on what type of campaign you want to play."
            },
            {
                "Question":"Can I play as a capital ship?",
                "Answer":"There are mods with capital ship command missions, but they are not common.  The Blade Itself, part of Blue Planet Complete, and Blue Planet: The Battle Captains are two mods where capital ship command missions can be played."
            },
            {
                "Question":"Why are there so many controls?  Do I need to learn all of them?  Why do some mods not have all of them?",
                "Answer":"As an older PC simulation game, there are a lot of controls that were added to allow players to play with different play styles.  You do not need to learn all of the controls, but knowing more of the targeting controls, communication shortcuts, and power transfer controls can help when playing on higher difficulties.  Mods can disable unneeded controls to simplify gameplay."

                "Question":"What can FSO be used for?",
                "Answer":"FSO can be used to create almost any type of game through our scripting library, but it is best suited for creating space and flight simulations."
            },
            {
                "Question":"How do I make missions and campaigns?",
                "Answer":"Missions can be created in FRED, our mission editor, and hopefully in the future with qtFRED.  A mission file is a human-readable text file, so experienced mission creators can make edits to existing missions via text editor, when needed."
            },
            {
                "Question":"What is FRED?",

            {
                "Question":"What is qtFRED?",

            },
            {
                "Question":"What are SEXPs?",
                "Answer":"SEXPs, or s-exps (symbolic expressions), are the building blocks for the gameplay logic in FreeSpace missions and campaigns.  SEXPs are adapted from the language Lisp and are very powerful.  Numerous SEXP operators have been added to the original basic collection implemented by Volition."
            },
            {
                "Question":"What is Lua, and how does FSO use it?",
                "Answer":"Lua is a full-fledged scripting language, distinct from FSO, but FSO provides ways for Lua to interface with it.  Scripts written in Lua can be added to mods to greatly increase the capabilities of the engine."
            },
            {
                "Question":"Does FSO support planet-side missions?",
                "Answer":"First of all, with scripting all things are possible, so write that down.  There are some mods with ground levels or levels with a planet landscape, but they generally require much more work to finish."
            },
            {
                "Question":"What are FSO’s model file formats?",
                "Answer":"We use a custom model file format called POF, or Parallax Object Format.  It can be edited with POF Tools, which supports gltf and dae export."

            },
            {
                "Question":"What are FSO’s image file formats?",
                "Answer":"FSO can use .jpg .png .dds .pcx and .tga image formats, but the highly preferred image format for in-game model textures is the appropriate dds format. .png is most often used for static UI images."
            },
            {
                "Question":"What are FSO’s animation and video file formats?",
                "Answer":".mve .msb .ogg .mp4 .srt .webm .png (apng) are all valid video files for FSO. We support apng files if their extension is .png.  .eff can also be used and is a special kind of 'animation' format which uses a set of regular images and a text file to create an animation."
            },
            {
                "Question":"Does FSO support model animations?",
